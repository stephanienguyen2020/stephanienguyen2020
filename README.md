# Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

**It's `Stephanie Ng.`**

👋 By day, I'm a CS student at Columbia University. By night, or more like whenever inspiration strikes, I'm a hacker, a problem-solver and a reverse engineering aficionado.

💻  I wrote my first line of code in summer 2023. Since then, I've dived deep into full-stack web development, AI/ML, cloud, and blockchain technologies. 

### ⌚ What I'm currently working on:

💡 Exploring Network Security, Generative AI and Computer Vision through self-study

💡 Automating processes and tackling complex, ambiguous problems in my projects

### 😁 Fun facts:

🌟 I've won 17 hackathons (including coding competitions, PM/design challenges, and pitching contests)! Each one has been a unique learning experience.

🤖 When I'm not coding, you can find me at tech meetups or tinkering with the latest AI models.

🌐 I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on society.

### 🏆 Some Achievements:
- Second Place at Databricks GenAI World Cup
- First Place at Amazon x CodePath Design for Accessibility Challenge
- First Place at Google Developer Group NYC's Build with AI 2024 Hackathon
- Runner Up at Regeneron's Health Tech Innovators
- Best Use of Unstructured.io at the MongoDB GenAI Hackathon
- Finalist at the 2024 TikTok TechJam

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project, chat about tech, or share hackathon stories!
